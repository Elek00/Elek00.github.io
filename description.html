      <h1> <strong> Brief description of the system </strong> </h1> 
      
      <p>
        ` In this project I am aiming to create a software system for users at travelodge located in Llanelli (Wales). 
          To start of with, I am going to give a brief introduction to the new system that I'm planning to do. </p> 
      
      <p> In contrast to the current system at Travelodge I will combine two languages together by network connection 
          which will provide sophisticated system feature of system interface that allows for database access,
          adding/deleting/editing/searching/sorting/saving records in the database, as well as controlling room temp. 
          from reception desk and feeding data from sensors using arduino microcontroller and presenting it to the user 
          in form of animated images like (picture to the right).This project is based around database software that has many
          friendly HCI features, booking software,many well designed algorithms, heavily featured with data collection from 
          digital sources, as well as outside analog sources like temperature of the room by using internet of things,
          high performance algorithmic calculations, wireless communication (network) using servers and arduino for data 
          collection and also for sending data (commands) over network to this system. </p>
